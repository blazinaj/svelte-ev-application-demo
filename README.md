## Getting started

### Installation

Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Starting the development server

Run the `dev` script to start a live development server with hot module replacement. Then check the output for a link
to the app, which is usually `http://localhost:5000/`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for production

Run the `build` script to bundle the app for production. The bundle will be created at `/dist/assets/` and the `dist`
directory will contain all files you need to host the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
